    <h2> Will I be able to attend for just one of the days?</h2>
    <p> Lyre festival has a strong emphasis on trying to provide an inclusive and enjoyable environment for all. However we also have a strong focus on sustainabilty and reducing emissions leaving as small an impact on the local environment as possible. As such there will only be ferries scheduled at limited times for the arrival day and the day of departure with none scheduled inbetween except in case of emergencies. So that being said, unfortunately our tickets only allow for visitors for the full extent of the festival</p>

      <h2> How many different genres of music will there be?</h2>
      <p> Due to the limited space that is available on the island, we are limited to only having 3 stages for our performances, and while we are unable to provide for everyones tastes we have strived to be as varied as possible while keeping the full lineup as cohesive as possible. Our full lineup will be released closer to the event so check for your favourite artists. </p>
